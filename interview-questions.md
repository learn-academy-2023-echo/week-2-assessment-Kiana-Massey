# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: parameters are within functions and arguments are values assigned to temporary variables.

Researched answer: parameters are within functions and arguments are values assigned to temporary variables. arguements are values that can be primitive or objects that are passed as input to a function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: arrays

Researched answer: The predefined parameters are function - required, currentValue - required, index - optional, arr - optional, and thisValue - optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map iterates through an array and .filter pulls specific values stated based on the function and/or conditions. both create new arrays.

Researched answer: filter creates an array with all the elements that are passed by a provided function. map creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: iteration repeats and runs through the code written until a condition is met.

Researched answer: iteration is a sequence of code being repeated until a specific result is met. there are 3 types of iteration - tail rescursion, while loops, and for loops.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: methods are a part of an object and functions are its own thing.

Researched answer: Functions and methods are the same in JavaScript, but a method is a function, which is a property of an object.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I am unaware of hoisting within javascript.

Researched answer: hoisting is a process that moves declarations to the top of the scope, prior to execution of the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: components are stand alone and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

2. Spread operator: spread operator quickly copies all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: react state is a built-in object in react that is used to hold data or information about the component. A component's state can also change over time.

4. React props: props pass data and values from one component to another to get dynamic and unique outputs.

5. DOM events: DOM stands for (Document Object Model). DOMS are events that signal that something has occurred, or is occurring, and can be triggered by user interactions or by the internet browser.
